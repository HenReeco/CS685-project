# CS685-project
Development of a genetic algorithm to calculate accuracy-energy consumption tradeoff for a on-body sensor device


GA.py is the main library with the function I use in the other two files (multiple_run_plot.py, plot_iterations.py).

To execute multiple_run_plot.py, make sure to pass the population size as an argument (suggested values are 8, 16, 32)
